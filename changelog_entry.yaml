    added:
      - Adds a `fiscalsim_us/parameters/gov/states/ut/README.md` that details specific approaches taken with the Utah tax form.
      - Adds all the Utah parameters to the ``fiscalsim_us/parameters/gov/states/ut` directory.
      - Adds a `fiscalsim_us/variables/gov/states/README.md` that details the steps to adding a state tax logic to the model.
      - Adds all the Utah variables to the ``fiscalsim_us/parameters/gov/states/ut` directory.
      - Updates the `state_income_tax.py` and `state_income_tax_before_refundable_credits.py` files with the appropriate Utah variables in the `/fiscalsim_us/variables/gov/states/tax/income/` directory.
      - Updates the `household_refundable_tax_credits.py` and `household_tax_before_refundable_credits.py` files with the appropriate Utah variables in the `/fiscalsim_us/variables/household/income/household/` directory.
      - Sets the default value to `False` in `/fiscalsim_us/variables/household/expense/health/has_marketplace_health_coverage.py`
      - `black` and `linecheck` formatted all new `.py` files.
