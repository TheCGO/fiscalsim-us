# Instructions for files in fiscalsim-us/docs

## Logo image files
The files in this directory `fiscalsim-us/docs/` include images and all the files necessary for rendering the Jupyter Book documentation. One image [`FiscalSimCGO_GitHubLogo.png`](docs/FiscalSimCGO_GitHubLogo.png) is used for both the GitHub social preview image and for the Jupyter Book logo. GitHub suggests that this image should be 1280x640px for best display.


## BibTeX reference files
The two files containing all the bibliographics references in the Jupyter Book documentation are BibTeX `.bib` files, used for making LaTeX citation references: [`citations.bib`](docs/book/citations.bib) and [`FiscalSim_references.bib`](docs/book/FiscalSim_references.bib).
* [`citations.bib`](docs/book/citations.bib) are the references used in the "Citations of FiscalSim US" section of the documentation.
* [`FiscalSim-US_references.bib`](docs/book/FiscalSim-US_references.bib) are the references used in the rest of the documentation.
