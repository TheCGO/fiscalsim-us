# Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP)

Paragraph outline:

What SNAP is, simply how benefits calculated, basic federal skeleton, state by state variation, brief program history, brief current research.


SNAP is the largest federal nutrition assistance program in the United States, and one of the largest poverty reduction programs in the United States. The 2022 SNAP federal budget was (x billion), and in 2022 there were approximately (x million) United States SNAP recipients.

Formerly known as food stamps, SNAP works to alleviate food insecurity by providing impoverished households with a monthly income support to purchase food. Eligibility for SNAP benefits are determined through a complex set of requirements that are basically established at the federal level, with several variations at the state level. The amount of SNAP benefit allotted according to a household's determined "income level" (accounting for gross income, and removing several deductions, including utilities, transportation, and extenuating circumstances like disability or care for the elderly) and number of members in the household. 

While the state variations exist, the basic structure of SNAP allotment remains the same: disbursed SNAP monthly allottment increases as income decreases, number of household members increase, deductions increase, and other extenuating circumstances increase. Interesting to note is that across states with various CPIs and standards of living, household quantity and determined household "income level" are associated with the same amount of SNAP allotment. That is to say, a family of 3 making $18,000/year in the Bay Area recieves as much SNAP benefits as a family of 3 in rural Utah making $18,000/year, despite vast differences in the purchasing power of those SNAP dollars. 

While the basic structure of SNAP established by federal tax code ensures a foundationally similar format across states, state-by-state variations make minor adjustments to SNAP eligibility and deductions that determine a household's net income. 

Concerning eligibility, the most significant state variations exist with the asset test and a gross income limit. States that are more generous with SNAP may abolish the asset test and a gross income limit--no matter how many assets a household has, or what their gross income is, as long as their calculated deductions are great enough to bring them under 100% of the Federal Poverty Level, then they may quality for SNAP. States that are more stringent with SNAP benefits may choose to establish deduction caps, limiting the amount of income that can be deducted to calculate final household net income. These states may also choose to include the various eligibility hurdles--namely, an asset test and an income limit. 

Although a 4 year period from 1939 to 1943 marked the first use of the food stamp program, the first Food Stamp Pilot Program occurred in 1961 from an executive order from President Kennedy. In 1964, the Food Stamp Act was passed to make the Food Stamp Program permanent. This orginal Food Stamp program, like the current iteration, was federally funded, with the states being responsible for certification and issuance of benefits. 

Since 1964, many legislative changes have been passed with SNAP, mostly concerning its funding, changes to eligibility requirements, deduction specifics, and allotment amounts. Between 1988 and 2004, food stamp benefits began to be disbursed through an Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) card, as opposed to manual vouchers. In 2008, the program name was changed from "Food Stamp Program" to "Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program" (SNAP). A nutrition education component of the program was created and came to be known as SNAP-Ed. During the COVID-19 pandemic from 2020-2023, emergency allotments were added to increase SNAP benefits. These emergency allotments were terminated in March of 2023 with the end of the pandemic. 

Much research exists investigating the effects of SNAP on various outcomes. Researchers monitor SNAP's economic effects (as a poverty reduction tool), it's nutritional effects (as a food security tool), and even a growing amount of research investigates various other markers of well-being and development outcomes related to SNAP use (such as CPS and neglect events, child academic performance, parental depression rates).
