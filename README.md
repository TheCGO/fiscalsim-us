FiscalSim US is a microsimulation model of the US state and federal household tax and benefit system.
It is supported and maintained by [The Center for Growth and Opportunity at Utah State Uhiversity](https://www.thecgo.org/). Much of the original federal tax and benefit code and some of the state tax logic was developed by [PolicyEngine](https://policyengine.org/), with their version of the code at [https://github.com/PolicyEngine/openfisca-us](https://github.com/PolicyEngine/openfisca-us).
