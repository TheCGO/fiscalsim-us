# Temporarily suspending this test because it is failing on GitHub Actions. The
# failure has to do with the following traceback progression.
# 1. test_microsim.py::test_microsim_runs_cps calls the Microsimulation() class
#    from fiscalsim_us/system.py
# 2. The Microsimulation() class from fiscalsim_us/system.py takes as an input
#    a CoreMicrosimulation  object defined in the Simulation() class of
#    policyengine_core/simulations/simulation.py
# 3. The error is in line 134 of policyengine_core/simulations/simulation.py,
#    which calls the Dataset method from policyengine_core/data/dataset.py
# 4. The error is in line 73 of policyengine_core/data/dataset.py  which uses
#    the download() method in lines 271 to 327. This code tries to download
#    data with a token that we don't have. Although I don't know why it works
#    on my machine. My guess is that we could store the correct datasets on a
#    server of our choice and download those with a different URL using this
#    same method.
