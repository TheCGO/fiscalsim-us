# Tests were generated from Tax-Calculator, but were amended after refactoring and editing variable names.
# `taxable_ss_magi` previously was `ymod`, which contains 50% of Social Security (in OpenFisca-US, this is
# added separately). Therefore, all `taxable_ss_magi` values have been corrected by removing half of social
# security inputs.
