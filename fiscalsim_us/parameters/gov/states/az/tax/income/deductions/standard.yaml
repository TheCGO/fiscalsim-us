  # The standard deduction chart on page 20 does not specify
  # a deduction amount of widow filers. Page 5 indicates that 
  # if a filer files as a widow on their federal return, they
  # may file as head of household on their AZ return.
  # Therefore, the deduction is the same as head of household.
