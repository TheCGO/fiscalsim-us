    # NYC School Tax Credit has its own definition of income.
    # "Income, for purposes of determining your New York City school tax credit, means your recomputed federal adjusted gross income from
    # Form IT-201, line 19a, minus distributions from an individual retirement account and an individual retirement annuity, from Form IT-201,
    # line 9, if they were included in your recomputed federal adjusted gross income."

    # Recomputed federal AGI is only different from federal AGI if you were required to report any adjustments due to Decoupling from the IRC.
    # If we choose to ignore this possibility for now, then I think School Tax Credit Income = Federal AGI
